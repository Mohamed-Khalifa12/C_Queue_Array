# C_Queue_Array
A Queue data structure which implemented with array in C language 
This has createQueue, enqueue and dequeue functions as a main function to this Data Structure.
I have used a helper function like isEmpty, isFull and PrintQueue which make the code more readable and easy in implemenation.
I've tests the code with these functions -simple test- in the main functoin. 
This Data Structure is implemented with Array :)
